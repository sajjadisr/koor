# Project Merge Summary

## What Was Accomplished

✅ **Successfully merged `/kore` and `/koor` folders into one complete project**

## Merge Details

### Files Merged from `/kore`:
- `firebase.json` → `firebase-config/firebase.json`
- `.firebaserc` → `firebase-config/.firebaserc`
- `firestore.rules` → `firebase-config/firestore.rules`
- `firestore.indexes.json` → `firebase-config/firestore.indexes.json`
- `storage.rules` → `firebase-config/storage.rules`
- `functions/` → `functions/` (entire directory)

### Enhanced `/koor` Project:
- Added Firebase CLI as dev dependency
- Added Firebase deployment scripts
- Created organized `firebase-config/` directory
- Integrated Cloud Functions
- Updated package.json with new scripts

## Current Project Structure

```
koor/                          # MAIN PROJECT (KEEP THIS)
├── public/                    # Frontend application
├── firebase-config/           # Firebase configuration (from /kore)
├── functions/                 # Cloud Functions (from /kore)
├── server.js                  # Backend server
├── package.json               # Updated with Firebase scripts
├── MERGED_PROJECT_README.md   # Complete documentation
├── cleanup-and-test.bat       # Windows test script
└── MERGE_SUMMARY.md           # This file

2. **Use the merged `/koor` project** for all development
3. **Deploy to Firebase** using the new configuration
4. **Run Cloud Functions** locally or deploy them

## Next Steps

1. **Test the merged project**:
   ```bash
   cd koor
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Verify everything works** in your browser

3. **Delete the old `/kore` folder** once satisfied

4. **Deploy to Firebase**:
   ```bash
   npm run firebase:deploy
   ```
